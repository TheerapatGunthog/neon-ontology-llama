owl:Transitive\n\n5.ปัญหา (issues)\n- ไม่มีการระบุ domain และ range ของ property\n- ไม่มีการระบุความสัมพันธ์เชิงความหมาย (syn-of)\n\n6.ความครอบคลุม (coverage)\n- instance ทุกตัวถูก assign เข้าสู่ class Skill\n\n7.ปัญหาการตั้งชื่อ (naming issues)\n- ชื่อ class และ property ไม่ได้ใช้ UpperCamelCase\n- ชื่อ instance มีช่องว่างและไม่เป็นไปตามมาตรฐาน\n\n8.ความซ้ำซ้อน (redundancy)\n- ไม่มี class ที่ซ้ำซ้อน\n\n9.ข้อเสนอแนะ (recommendations)\n- ควรระบุ domain และ range ของ property\n- ปรับปรุงการตั้งชื่อให้เป็นไปตามมาตรฐาน UpperCamelCase\n- พิจารณาเพิ่มความสัมพันธ์เชิงความหมาย (syn-of)
